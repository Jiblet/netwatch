# NetWatch

Network presence scanner using `arp-scan`, Discord alerts, and vendor suppression.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Mobile devices sleep and vanish at random.
- ARP is unreliable for long-term presence tracking.
- Flaps galore. Don’t expect accuracy.

## ✅ Features

- Discord webhook alerts when devices join/leave
- Vendor-based suppression
- Color-coded embeds
- Hostname resolution via avahi/nmblookup

## 🛑 Status

**Archived. Not actively maintained.**

This worked okay for testing presence, but is fundamentally flawed for any useful device tracking. Leaving here for posterity. 
And for Future-Jiblet.
